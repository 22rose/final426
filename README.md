# 426finalproject

For our final project, we decided to create a personal online journal form for users. 
The application allows user to create/register an account and subsequently be able to log in with it. 
When logged in, a user will see their registration Id and and programing joke that is retrieved from this [3rd party API:](https://sv443.net/jokeapi/v2/)
When logged in, the user has the ability to create new journal entries. Each journal entry also has options for deleting or editing.
The user also has the to update their password. When its updated, subsequent logins naturally will need this new updated password
A user also has the ability to logout without worrying about losing their data. As long as the user exists, they can retrieve their data
A user also has the ability to delete their account. When it's deleted, they lose their data and will have to essentially re-register, create new entries, etc
